# Project Euler 50
I love Project Euler! It was one of the puzzle sites (besides Rosalind) I found early in my programming days. Especially in late High School and early college, I would work on various PE problems in C or C++ to try to learn algorithms. It is always a good idea to revisit them when you can. I have no idea if I have worked on problem 50 before, so it is fresh enough to try again in Python.

The full description of the problem can be found on the [problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=50) but essentially, I need to write a program that will do the following:

> Which prime number under 1,000,000 is the sum of the most consecutive primes? (Ex: under 100, the answer is 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13)
