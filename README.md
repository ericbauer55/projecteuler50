# Project Euler 50
I love Project Euler! It was one of the puzzle sites (besides Rosalind) I found early in my programming days. Especially in late High School and early college, I would work on various PE problems in C or C++ to try to learn algorithms. It is always a good idea to revisit them when you can. I have no idea if I have worked on problem 50 before, so it is fresh enough to try again in Python.

The full description of the problem can be found on the [problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=50) but essentially, I need to write a program that will do the following:

> Which prime number under 1,000,000 is the sum of the most consecutive primes? (Ex: under 100, the answer is 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13) 

## Solution Checklist
- [ ] Draft algorithm pseudo code for README
- [ ] Write Unit tests for example solutions (*A*<sub>max</sub> = [100, 1000])
- [ ] Write algorithm code framework in Python 
- [ ] Test the framework using Triangular Sums 
- [ ] Create a Prime Number generator
- [ ] Run sample problem specific unit tests
- [ ] Run algorithm for *A*<sub>max</sub> = 1,000,000 and submit to PE
